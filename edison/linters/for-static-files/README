The files in this folder are used by the static files lint CI located at ".github/workflows/static-files-lint.yml".

# CI overview

    That particular CI runs on Node.js server, so packages required for this CI need to be installed via "npm".
    npm installs packages inside a folder (automatically created in the PWD) called "node_modules".
    npm uses two files in order to install required packages:
        1.  package.json - this file holds various metadata relevant to the project.
                This file is used to give information to npm that allows it to identify the project as well as handle the project"s dependencies.
        2.  package-lock.json - automatically generated for any operations where npm modifies either the node_modules tree, or package.json.
                It describes the exact tree that was generated, such that subsequent installs are able to generate identical trees, regardless of intermediate dependency updates.

    The static files lint CI runs the scripts described inside package.json to apply the linters analysis.

# Packages being used

    The main packages being used by that CI are:
        1.  ESLint - The most popular JavaScript linter, a tool that analyzes code for errors, which can include stylistic errors but also coding errors that lead to bugs.
        2.  Prettier - A tool used for analyzing the HTML, CSS, JSON and yml in our project for stylistic errors and errors that lead to bugs.

# Linters usage

    If you wish to use those tools as part of your development process you should first install npm on your machine (it comes with the installment of Node.js).
    Now follow these steps:
        1.  Enter the folder at this path - edison/linters/for-static-files.
        2.  Run "npm install".
    A folder called "node_modules" should be created inside the current directory.

    To use ESLint run "npm run lint:eslint".
    To use Prettier run "npm run lint:prettier".
    To format the code run "npm run prettier:format".
